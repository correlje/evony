first of all:

have 2 cities around the forest or hill (needs to be level 9 or 10, both work just as good,
 10's more losses but slightly more res gain)



then have one city at most 1.4 miles away from the forest
this city needs all attack heros in it (to reduce losses)
and run this script

( CHANGE XXX,YYY TO COORDS OF FOREST/HILL CHANGE TRAININGHERO TO MAIN HERO NAME AND MAYOR TO MAYORS NAME)

attack XXX,YYY any,!traininghero,!mayor a:30k,b:4500,s:1,c:1,sw:1,p:1,wo:1,w:1,cata:1
sleep 50
releasehero prisoner
loop

then in the city that is between 1-5 miles away
run this script.

(CHANGE SPAMHERO TO THE NAME OF A HERO YOU DONT MIND LOOSING you only lose heros if some cunt steals your forest)
change XXX,YYY to coords of forest/hill.
this script will cap and abandon the forest/hill, it will automatically stop at maint so that you dont lose a lvl 10 to maint.
there are several "abandon xxx,yyy" lines, this makes it slightly cpu heavy, but it is just a fail safe and it makes sure that
 the script can be ran at a range of 1-5 miles away.





1: abandon XXX,YYY
2: attack XXX,YYY SPAMHERO,!traininghero,mayor s:1
3: abandon XXX,YYY
4: releasehero prisoner
5: abandon XXX,YYY
6: sleep 10
7: abandon XXX,YYY
8: ifgoto ( m_context.maintenanceStart != 0 ) HOLDIT
9: loop SPAMMER
label HOLDIT
10: attack XXX,YYY any,!traininghero s:10
11: repeat 500
12: goto SPAMMER


enjoy unlimited res and meds!!!
