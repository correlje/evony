// When incoming attacks are spotted or your gates are broken, it will talk outloud thru your speakers, and in ally chat.
// It will ignore incoming attacks from any of the specified alliances, so you can attack your alts or be treb hit by alts without spamming AC.
// You can disable config warrules and audio attack/tts attack warning if you use this, since it covers all 3 areas.
