VALLEY FARMING

You need 2 cities:

 	City A (which is where you will collect res/medals) 
	City B (which will cap and release a valley) 

Ok city A needs to have full valleys, it doesn’t matter which type, but FULL valleys. Next it needs to be 1mile from the valley you want to farm. 
(level 10 forrest give about 1mi wood average per hit. Hills give much less, about 300k avg from my exp. A level 10 lake gives about 1mil also.) 
Ok so you get all your valleys and you have level 10 valley to farm 1mile from your city. These coords will be called XXX,YYY later on so write 
them down.  You need to set these goals so you don’t release any valleys via the bot. 

config buildnpc:0
config valley:0
config npc:0 

you wont be farming npcs from here anymore. And you can’t have any commands that will cause you to release a valley for any reason. 


*NOTE: Its best if you can also have another valley, of any type, within a mile also but one as close as possible and write this coord as coord CCC,RRR. 

*NOTE: Also I would never let your tophero or poli hero do valley farming. Theres always the chance that an enemy could cap your valley then you
 attack it after and possibly lose the battle. If this happens you always run the risk of losing the hero. But we all know that. I ‘try’ to 
prevent this by making my troops I use more than the usual number sent by the default setting for valley farming. Most people are lazy and do
 not take the time to identify the valleytroops goal.

Ok city B needs to be 1 mile away also, no more than 3 miles, have AT LEAST ONE open valley slot. (I’d recommend getting all the valleys you
 need for your city type then turning off the valley command here also: config valley:0) You can farm npc 5’s from here if you want, but make
 sure you keep at least 4 heroes idle at all times. (so you can farm 4, have 1 mayor, 4 spare and room for training hero to come in. If you want
 to try to be greedy you can prob do 5 or even 6 farming heroes) Remember the further you are away from the valley, the more idle heroes you will need.
 1 mile is the best. Do this by doing the following:

Label 4 heroes to farm 5’s:

config npc:5
npcheroes tophero,hero1,hero2,hero3,hero4

You can also build npcs if you want from City B. 

config npc:15

But remember, the bot may try to take your idle heroes to go hit flats and build npcs. I believe if you label heroes not to be spam, that also
 makes them not used for flat building so try this. 

notspamheroes tophero,hero1,hero2,hero3,hero4    ? your idle heroes. 

*NOTE: you should always have your top hero listed as a notspamhero as well as any other heroes you are not willing to lose. 

Ok, once this is set up you are ready for the scripts. 

In City A put this script. 



label farm
healtroops
ifgosub ( $m_city.cityManager.maintenanceTime$ != -1 ) maintenance 
label farmit
attack 626,762 any, a:25000,w:1,wo:1,p:1,sw:1,c:1,cata:1,t:200,s:100,b:1500
sleep 57
loop 0 farm

label maintenance
recall 626,762
abandon 627,761
attack 626,762 any s:100000
sleep 15
attack 626,762 any s:100000
sleep 920
abandon 626,762
attack 627,761 any s:100000
sleep 30
recall 627,761
goto farm

*Remember XXX,YYY is the coord of the level 10 valley you will be farming and CCC,RRR is the coord of the other valley close by. You will be using
 CCC,RRR to release during maint and cap your valley you are farming. Then after maint, it will release your farming valley (XXX,YYY), recap your other
 valley (CCC,RRR) and then get back to farming for you. 










In City B you will need this. 

abandon 626,762
ifgosub ( $m_city.cityManager.maintenanceTime$ != -1 ) maintenance 
attack 626,762 any,!b67,b68 s:1
sleep 10
abandon 626,762 
loop 


label maintenance
recall 626,762
sleep 1000
loop

Ok.. this should be all you need to get going. Now some side notes/tips. 


I would set this city up for trading with resource limits so you can trade all this new free res you are getting for what you need. Food, iron, stone, etc. 

I would also set up sendtroop/keeptroop (depending on if you are YAEB or AutoEvony) commands to send archers from other cities to City A. You wanna maintain
 enough to run 8 teams full time. You can make up to 800mil wood a day I’ve personally seen and 500mil+ should be no problem. 

Remember to keep scouts in City B or you will not be able to do this successfully. 

If it’s not working go back and check the simple things before saying it doesn’t work, cuz it does. 

Do both cities have troops required? 

Does City A have 10 valleys?

Does City B have an open valley slot? 

Are your bot setting right so it doesn’t release valleys in City A?
